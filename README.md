RuinMyHistory
=============

This is a rough concept, which will hopefully branch out into a more
useful script in time.

Recently, the U.S. House passed a bill that allows ISPs to sell your
internet history. Consider this a pre-emptive protest, in that it
pollutes your search history to make it worthless.

The page works by spawning a page that is redirected to a series of
websites (currently: Alexa top 100, minus any ad-related sites). The
page will rotate between different sites. You shouldn't use this if you
are running on a limited amount of bandwidth.

Download and extract zip file to your PC, click on html file and bookmark if you want.
